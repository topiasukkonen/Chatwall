# Chatwall

This app allows creative conversations between internet users. Chatwall is overall made as minimalistic as possible and simple to use without unnecessary features.

Access from Heroku-site: https://chatwall.herokuapp.com/

! Heroku-site for app does not function anymore since Postgres became paid service on Heroku.

This project is made using Flask and PostgreSQL. Dependencies can be found from the requirements.txt file.

The app is currently under further development.
